Your current role: Assistant Professor, Zhejiang University 

Your memory: There are three very personal memories that immediately come to mind. The first is when Prof. Gao honored me by invited me to his office (I believe in my 3rd year) to discuss some matters and he eneded our converstation by saying he would "now treat me as a graduate student." As an undergradute engineer, I left his office floating, filled with nothing but a desire to never let him down (I still think about this). The second memory is a discussion I had with him regarding my choice in graduate school. He expressed his utter regret that I would leave U of D and him for a different opprtunity. We both knew it was the correct choice, but I still reflect on how it pained him to see me go and his desire that he could "start over again" seeing me go --- not that he had any great regret, instead it was the idea of starting a new adventure with few constraints. I did not appretiate his sentiment at the time, but I am growing to appretiate it. My fondest recollection is of the time my dear departed Grandma B came to visit me at U of D. We were visiting Evans Hall and my office at the time when we ran inexpectedly with Prof. Gao in the hallway. He greeted us, he bowed deeply to her, and expressed how happy he was to have me as part of his team. My grandmother had no conception of what I was doing in research or any real appretiation for the hard work I was doing, but to have a professor honor her (I am unsure if she ever even graduated from high school) in such a way made an indelible impact on her (and on me --- this is the way to honor those who work so hard for you). Goodbye Prof. Gao --- I am sorry you are gone.
